This project is a part of Ironhack Data Analytics Full Time Bootcamp course.
# 1. Project Description
Today's World benefits the Machine Learning methods to make the life easier and less complicated. One of the most popular and being great demand is recommendation systems. Major businesses create their own recommendation systems such as movies, songs etc.

To be able to understand the contemporary world and to be part of it, as a Data Analyst, building the recommender systems are really important and progressive

In my project its been used different two datasets. 

One is from best books ever dataset: https://zenodo.org/record/4265096#.Yb893mDMK70 which contains 52k total records and total number of rating etc.

Second is the webscraped dataset, which containts high ranked books from 2021 according to The Times magazine.
# 2. My Motivation
To be able to create analytical systems, understanding the recommender systems and to be able to progress my story telling and analytical skills.

Books are subjective.. According to one dataset one book might have ranked really high but to another dataset it could be different. MY major point is creating Machine Learning models, testing and create a story from it. 
# 3. Tools that I used
The main technologies used here are Python and Tableau Public. The raw data file has been imported and wrangled in Jupyter notebook using Pandas, clean .csv files exported & imported & joined in Tableau for visualizations. For the Machine Learning, CLustering and KNeigbours methods are used.

For the answers that my colleagues required i used my dataset in MySQL as well.

# 4. Challenges
The Dataset itself is really challenging. My main challenge is clustering the books by genres. For the EDA purposes its quite useful but for the data wrangling it requires a significant and clean work.

Creating the whole system and the pipelines requires deep thinking and problem solution skills. To be able to create elegant solutions,the whole recommender system requires careful approach.
# 5. How to USE or Install
The project is straightforward to install, use & modify:

Fork & clone the entire repo on your hard-drive
Download the main dataset https://zenodo.org/record/4265096#.Yb893mDMK70

Run the Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) in your preferred Python IDE
